# CUPS-IPP Remote Vulnerability Detector

## Overview

This project is a work-in-progress tool designed to detect potential vulnerabilities in CUPS (Common Unix Printing System), specifically those related to CVE-2024-47176 and associated issues in cups-browsed and IPP handling. It's based on the research detailed in the blog post [Attacking UNIX Systems via CUPS, Part I](https://evilsocket.net/2024/09/26/Attacking-UNIX-systems-via-CUPS-Part-I/).

## Features

- Discovers printers on the local network using Zeroconf
- Sends specially crafted UDP packets to port 631
- Probes for IPP (Internet Printing Protocol) information
- Checks for CUPS-specific indicators in IPP responses
- Examines printer web interfaces for CUPS references

## Limitations

- This tool is for detection only and does not attempt exploitation
- It cannot definitively confirm the presence of vulnerabilities, only potential indicators
- The script doesn't check all components mentioned in the original vulnerability report
- Detection methods may produce false positives or negatives

## Usage

```
python3 discover.py <printer_ip>
```
or
```
python3 discover.py discover
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: `requests`, `zeroconf`

To install the required packages, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Disclaimer

This tool is for educational and research purposes only. Always obtain proper authorization before scanning any networks or systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.

## Contributing

This is a work-in-progress project, and community input is highly valued and encouraged. If you have suggestions for improvements, additional detection methods, or bug fixes, please feel free to:

1. Open an issue to discuss proposed changes
2. Submit a pull request with your improvements
3. Share your experiences and findings using this tool

We're particularly interested in:
- Improving detection accuracy
- Expanding the range of CUPS-related vulnerabilities detected
- Enhancing the tool's performance and reliability
- Adding support for different environments and CUPS versions

## Future Work

- Implement more comprehensive checks for all components mentioned in the original vulnerability report
- Develop methods to reduce false positives and negatives
- Add options for more detailed scans and reporting
- Explore potential for safe, controlled exploitation to confirm vulnerabilities
